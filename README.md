# TechChallenge_VirtualAssistant

This project is a prototype of a document querying system that uses word vector embeedding to identify sentences in a document that most closely match the semantic meaning of a query against that document.

I haven't yet set up a requiremets.txt file or a virtualenv for the project yet, but the requirements are relatively core libraries of a typical NLP-based data science stack. 

You will have to install the large web model for spacy in the environment that you are running the project in. 
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
